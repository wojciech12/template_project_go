**Reviewer Perspective:** Senior Anthropic Engineer with extensive Go and AI experience  
**Review Date:** 2025-08-07  
**Content Reviewed:** slides.md presentation for Go+AI development best practices

## Executive Summary

This presentation covers practical aspects of integrating Claude Code into Go development workflows. While it contains valuable experiential insights, the content suffers from several technical inaccuracies, incomplete coverage of critical topics, and lacks the depth expected for a technical audience. The presentation would benefit from significant restructuring and additional technical detail.

## 1. Technical Accuracy & Correctness

### Critical Inaccuracies

**Model Information (Slides 46-50):**
- **Error**: Claims "Antrophic models lead" - should be "Anthropic"
- **Inaccuracy**: Cut-off date listed as "march 2025" is incorrect. As of January 2025, Claude models have training data cutoffs in early 2024, not March 2025
- **Missing Context**: No mention of specific model versions (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, etc.) or their respective capabilities and use cases

**Model Comparison (Slides 54-60):**
- **Incomplete**: States "Models have strengths and weaknesses" but provides no actual comparison
- **Missing Detail**: Lists "Claude Code" and "Gemini" without explaining what makes each suitable for different Go development scenarios
- **Technical Gap**: No discussion of context window sizes, token limits, or performance characteristics relevant to Go codebases

### Documentation References

**Memory System (Slides 87-94):**
- **Correct**: Accurately states that `.claude/memory` content is not automatically read
- **Good Practice**: Correctly recommends using memory for one-off prompts and storing best practices
- **Missing**: No explanation of memory file naming conventions or organization strategies

## 2. Go Development Context

### Strengths
- **Repository Structure (Slide 104-109)**: Good emphasis on modular design and vertical project structure
- **Tool Integration**: Mentions `CLAUDE.md` files in subfolders, which aligns with Go's package-oriented structure

### Critical Gaps

**Go-Specific Challenges Not Addressed:**
- No discussion of Go module management with AI assistance
- Missing coverage of Go's strict formatting rules (gofmt) and how Claude Code handles them
- No mention of Go's testing conventions (`*_test.go` files) and AI-assisted test generation
- Absence of Go-specific tooling integration (golangci-lint, go vet, etc.)

**Go Ecosystem Integration:**
- No discussion of working with Go's package system
- Missing guidance on handling Go's interface design patterns with AI
- No coverage of Go's concurrency patterns (goroutines, channels) and AI assistance

**Build and Deployment:**
- No mention of Go build processes, cross-compilation, or deployment patterns
- Missing integration with Go's extensive toolchain

## 3. Claude Code Integration Depth

### Adequate Coverage
- **Configuration**: Good emphasis on `CLAUDE.md` maintenance and updates
- **Memory System**: Appropriate coverage of `.claude/memory` usage patterns
- **Context Management**: Solid framework for understanding context hierarchy

### Missing Critical Elements

**Advanced Features:**
- **Hooks (Slide 156)**: Mentioned but not explained - what are Claude Code hooks and how do they integrate with Go development?
- **MCP Servers**: Limited to context7 mention without explaining Model Context Protocol integration
- **OpenTelemetry**: Listed without context on how it applies to AI-assisted development

**Workflow Integration:**
- No discussion of Claude Code's file editing capabilities
- Missing coverage of multi-file refactoring workflows
- No mention of code review and validation processes
- Absence of error handling and debugging with AI assistance

## 4. Content Structure & Clarity

### Structural Issues

**Information Density:**
- **Slide 23**: "dev < dev + AI" is cryptic and needs explanation
- **Slide 25**: "A lot of noise" is vague - needs specific examples of what constitutes "noise" in AI development
- **Slide 115**: Incomplete code snippet: "Read .claude/memory/* and ... use command ..."

**Logical Flow Problems:**
- Tools section (Slides 152-169) introduces concepts without context
- Context management appears in multiple sections without clear hierarchy
- Demo announcement (Slide 200) comes abruptly without transition

**Visual Integration:**
- Heavy reliance on images without alternative text or explanations
- Venn diagram (Slide 37) referenced without context or explanation
- Prompt structure diagram (Slide 142) is valuable but not integrated with surrounding content

## 5. Missing Critical Elements
